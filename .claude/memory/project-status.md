## Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Status | Notes |
|------------|------|--------|-------|
| OpenAI API | External | Required | For embeddings |
| Qdrant Cloud | External | Required | Primary vector store |
| Poetry | Tool | Available | Package management |

---

## Next Actions

Priority actions to continue progress:

- [ ] Add specifications to `.claude/resources/`
- [ ] Run `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
- [ ] Run `/implement "Phase 1"` to begin implementation

### Recommended Commands

Based on current state, recommended next steps:

```bash
# Add your specification document to resources:
# cp /path/to/spec.md .claude/resources/

# Then generate the implementation plan:
/speckit.plan

# When ready to implement:
/implement "Phase 1"

# To check current status anytime:
/implement
```

## Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Status | Completion Date |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| Planning Complete | TBD | PENDING | |
| Phase 1 Complete | TBD | PENDING | |
| MVP Ready | TBD | PENDING | |
| Full Implementation | TBD | PENDING | |
