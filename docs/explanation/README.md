# Explanation

**Understanding-oriented** documentation that clarifies concepts and provides context.

## Purpose

Explanation documentation helps users understand the "why" behind the project. It provides background, context, and reasoning that helps users build a mental model of how things work and why they were designed that way.

## Writing Guidelines

- **Provide context**: Explain the background and history when relevant
- **Discuss alternatives**: Why was this approach chosen over others?
- **Connect concepts**: Show how different parts relate to each other
- **Use examples**: Illustrate abstract concepts with concrete scenarios
- **Avoid instructions**: Don't include step-by-step procedures
