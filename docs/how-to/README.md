# How-to Guides

**Task-oriented** documentation that provides practical steps to solve specific problems.

## Purpose

How-to guides help users accomplish specific tasks. Unlike tutorials, they assume the reader already knows what they want to do and has basic familiarity with the project.

## Writing Guidelines

- **Start with the problem**: Clearly state what task this guide addresses
- **List prerequisites**: What must be in place before starting
- **Use numbered steps**: Make the sequence clear and scannable
- **Stay focused**: Include only what's necessary to complete the task
- **Link to references**: Point to detailed docs for options you mention
