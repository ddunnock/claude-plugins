# Problem Statement — [Project Name]

**Session:** [session_id]
**Date:** [date]
**Phase:** Problem Definition (Phase 2)

## The Problem

[2-3 paragraph problem statement describing the gap between current state and desired state. No embedded cause or solution.]

---

## Current State

[Description of how things work today. Be specific about operational realities, pain points, and limitations.]

---

## Consequences

[What happens if nothing changes. Quantify where possible.]

| Consequence | Impact | Affected Stakeholders |
|-------------|--------|----------------------|
| [Consequence 1] | [Quantified impact] | [Who] |
| [Consequence 2] | [Quantified impact] | [Who] |

---

## Desired State

[What "solved" looks like. Focus on capabilities and outcomes, not implementation.]

---

## Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Role | How Affected | Priority Need |
|-------------|------|-------------|---------------|
| [Stakeholder 1] | [Role] | [Impact] | [What they need] |
| [Stakeholder 2] | [Role] | [Impact] | [What they need] |

---

## Scope

### In Scope
- [What this concept WILL address]
- [Included domains/functions]

### Out of Scope
- [What this concept will NOT address]
- [Excluded domains/functions]
- [Explicitly deferred items]

| # | Solution Idea | Captured During | Notes |
|---|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | [Solution/technology idea] | [Which question] | [Brief context] |
| 2 | [Solution/technology idea] | [Which question] | [Brief context] |

---

## Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Category | Impact if Wrong |
|----|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| [A-001] | [Assumption text] | [scope/feasibility/domain_knowledge] | [Impact] |
