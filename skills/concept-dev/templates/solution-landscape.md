- Sources cited: [N]
- Open gaps: [N]

### Research Methodology
- **Tools used:** [List of research tools available during this session]
- **Search strategy:** Broad discovery via WebSearch, deep dives via [available tools]
- **Time period:** Research conducted [date]
- **Confidence framework:** HIGH (peer-reviewed/official), MEDIUM (credible/unverified), LOW (single source), UNGROUNDED (training data)
