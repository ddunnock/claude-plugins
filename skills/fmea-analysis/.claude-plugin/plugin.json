  "description": "Conduct Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) for systematic identification and risk assessment of potential failures in designs, processes, or systems. Supports DFMEA (Design), PFMEA (Process), and FMEA-MSR (Monitoring & System Response). Uses AIAG-VDA 7-step methodology with Action Priority (AP) risk assessment replacing traditional RPN. Use when analyzing product designs for potential failures, evaluating manufacturing process risks, conducting proactive risk assessment, preparing for APQP/PPAP submissions, investigating field failures, or when user mentions \"FMEA\", \"failure mode\", \"DFMEA\", \"PFMEA\", \"severity occurrence detection\", \"RPN\", \"Action Priority\", \"design risk analysis\", or needs to identify and prioritize potential failure modes with their causes and effects.",
