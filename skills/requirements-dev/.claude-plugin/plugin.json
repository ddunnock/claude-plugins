  "description": "Transform concept development artifacts into INCOSE-compliant formal requirements. AI-assisted requirements development with hybrid quality checking (16 deterministic + 9 semantic INCOSE GtWR v4 rules), verification planning, bidirectional traceability, gap analysis against concept architecture, assumption lifecycle management, and ReqIF export. Organized around functional blocks from concept development. Includes cross-cutting notes registry, need/requirement split workflow, gap discovery agent, assumption tracker, 5 specialized agents (quality-checker, tpm-researcher, skeptic, gap-analyst, document-writer), 16 scripts, 10 commands, and hooks for automatic state updates. Use when developing requirements, formalizing needs, writing specifications, building traceability, analyzing coverage gaps, managing assumptions, or preparing for systems engineering reviews.",
