# Project Status

## Purpose

Track overall project implementation progress, phase completion, and next actions. This file is AUTOMATICALLY updated by `/speckit.implement` after each execution.

---

## Current State

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Project | [PROJECT_NAME] |
| Spec Source | [SPEC_FILE_REFERENCE] |
| Current Phase | Phase [N]: [Phase Name] |
| Total Tasks | [TOTAL] |
| Completed | [COMPLETED] |
| In Progress | [IN_PROGRESS] |
| Blocked | [BLOCKED] |
| Pending | [PENDING] |
| Progress | [PERCENTAGE]% |
| Last Updated | [ISO_TIMESTAMP] |

## Execution Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Sessions Completed | [COUNT] |
| Tasks Completed | [COMPLETED_COUNT] |
| Avg Tasks per Session | [AVG_PER_SESSION] |
| Current Streak | [STREAK] tasks |

### Per-Phase Breakdown

| Phase | Tasks | Completed | Sessions | Avg per Session |
|-------|-------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Phase 1: [Name] | [N] | [M] | [S] | [AVG] |
| Phase 2: [Name] | [N] | [M] | [S] | [AVG] |
| Phase 3: [Name] | [N] | [M] | [S] | [AVG] |

### Velocity Trend

| Period | Tasks Completed | Trend |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Last Session | [N] | — |
| Last 3 Sessions | [AVG] | [↑/→/↓] |
| All Time | [AVG] | — |

## Session Continuity

Track session state to enable seamless resume across Claude sessions.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Last Session | [ISO_TIMESTAMP] |
| Session Duration | [DURATION] |
| Stopped At | [DESCRIPTION] |
| Stop Reason | [clean/interrupted/error] |
| Resume Command | `[COMMAND]` |

### Resume Context

When resuming, Claude should:
1. Read this file first
2. Check "Stopped At" for context
3. Run the Resume Command
4. Continue from where the session ended

### Session History (Last 5)

| Date | Duration | Tasks | Stopped At | Reason |
|------|----------|-------|------------|--------|
| [DATE] | [DUR] | [N] | [DESCRIPTION] | [REASON] |

### Quick Resume

```bash
# Resume from last session
/implement --continue

# Or run the specific resume command:
[RESUME_COMMAND]
```

## Next Actions

Priority actions to continue progress:

- [ ] [Immediate next action with specific command]
- [ ] [Following action]
- [ ] [Future action]

### Recommended Commands

Based on current state, recommended next steps:

```bash
# If current phase incomplete:
/speckit.implement "Phase [N]"

# If specific tasks failed:
/speckit.implement TASK-XXX

# If phase complete, proceed to next:
/speckit.implement "Phase [N+1]"

# For consistency check:
/speckit.analyze

# To review tasks:
cat speckit/*-tasks.md
```
