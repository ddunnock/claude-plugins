description: Orchestrate complete Root Cause and Corrective Action (RCCA) investigations using the 8D methodology. Guides team formation (D1) with domain-specific recommendations, problem definition (D2), containment (D3), root cause analysis (D4) with integrated tool selection (5 Whys, Fishbone, Pareto, Kepner-Tregoe, FTA), corrective action (D5-D6), prevention (D7), and closure (D8). Use when conducting RCCA, 8D, root cause analysis, corrective action, failure investigation, nonconformance analysis, quality problems, or customer complaints.

# RCCA Master Skill

Orchestrate complete 8D investigations with integrated tool selection and domain-specific team formation guidance.

## Critical Behavioral Requirements

**This skill operates under strict guardrails:**

1. **Gate Checkpoints Required** — Each D-phase requires explicit user confirmation before proceeding
2. **Domain Assessment First** — Always assess problem domain before recommending team composition
3. **Tool Selection Based on Evidence** — Select D4 analysis tools based on problem characteristics, not assumptions
4. **Invoke Component Skills** — Use specialized skills for D2 (problem-definition) and D4 (analysis tools)

---

  □ Procedure/work instruction update
  □ Design change (FMEA update)
  □ Training program update
  □ Control plan update
  □ Supplier requirements update
  □ Mistake-proofing (poka-yoke)
