# Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa) Analysis

Create structured cause-and-effect diagrams to systematically identify potential root causes of problems. This skill guides collaborative brainstorming, ensures comprehensive category coverage, and produces visual outputs.

## Integration with Other RCCA Tools

The Fishbone Diagram provides **breadth** (identifying all possible causes across categories), while 5 Whys provides **depth** (drilling into specific causes). Typical workflow:
1. Use Fishbone to brainstorm and categorize all potential causes
2. Prioritize top 2-3 causes via multi-voting
3. Apply 5 Whys to each prioritized cause to find root causes

Also integrates with: Pareto Analysis (prioritize by frequency/impact), FMEA (risk assessment), 8D (Problem Definition phase).

## Workflow Overview

**6 Phases** (Q&A-driven):
1. **Problem Definition** → Clear, specific effect statement
2. **Category Selection** → Choose framework (6Ms/8Ps/4Ss/custom)
3. **Cause Brainstorming** → Identify causes under each category
4. **Sub-cause Drilling** → Add 2-3 levels of detail
5. **Prioritization** → Multi-voting to identify top causes
6. **Documentation** → Generate diagram and report

## Phase 1: Problem Definition

**Goal**: Establish a clear, specific, measurable problem statement.

Ask the user:
> What specific problem or effect are you trying to analyze?
> 
> A good problem statement is:
> - **Specific**: "Machine 4 overheated at 2 PM" not "Machine broke"
> - **Measurable**: Include quantities, frequencies, or timeframes when possible
> - **Observable**: Describes what happened, not why
> - **Non-blaming**: Focus on the situation, not individuals

**Quality Gate**: Problem statement must:
- [ ] Describe observable effect (not assumed cause)
- [ ] Be specific enough to guide focused analysis
- [ ] Avoid embedding solutions or blame

If vague, ask: "Can you be more specific about [what/when/where/how much]?"

## Phase 2: Category Selection

**Goal**: Select appropriate cause categories for the analysis context.

Present options:
> Which category framework fits your analysis context?
>
> **6Ms** (Manufacturing/Operations):
> - Man (People), Machine, Method, Material, Measurement, Mother Nature (Environment)
>
> **8Ps** (Service/Marketing):
> - Product, Price, Place, Promotion, People, Process, Physical Evidence, Policies
>
> **4Ss** (Service Operations):
> - Surroundings, Suppliers, Systems, Skills
>
> **Custom**: Define your own categories based on your specific domain
>
> Or describe your context and I'll recommend an appropriate framework.

For detailed category definitions and prompting questions, see: `references/category-frameworks.md`

## Phase 3: Cause Brainstorming

**Goal**: Generate comprehensive list of potential causes under each category.

For each category, ask:
> Under **[Category]**, what factors might contribute to "[Problem]"?
> 
> Think about:
> - What could go wrong in this area?
> - What variations or inconsistencies exist?
> - What has changed recently?

**Facilitation techniques** (see `references/facilitation-guide.md`):
- **Round-robin**: Each participant contributes one cause, rotate until exhausted
- **Brainwriting**: Silent individual brainstorming on sticky notes before discussion
- **Affinity grouping**: Cluster related causes together
- **"Why does this happen?"**: Probe each cause for deeper understanding

**Quality indicators**:
- Minimum 2-3 causes per category (empty categories may indicate blind spots)
- Mix of obvious and non-obvious causes
- Causes should be distinct (not restating the problem)

## Phase 4: Sub-cause Drilling

**Goal**: Add depth to major causes with 2-3 levels of sub-causes.

For significant causes, ask:
> For the cause "[Cause]", what specific factors contribute to it?
> 
> Ask "Why might this happen?" to uncover sub-causes.

**Depth guidance**:
- Level 1: Direct causes (e.g., "Equipment malfunction")
- Level 2: Contributing factors (e.g., "Lack of maintenance")
- Level 3: Root-level factors (e.g., "No maintenance schedule defined")

Typically 2-3 levels is sufficient. If more depth needed, transition to 5 Whys analysis.

## Phase 5: Prioritization

**Goal**: Identify most likely/impactful causes for focused investigation.

Present prioritization options:
> How would you like to prioritize the identified causes?
>
> **Multi-voting** (Recommended): Each participant gets 3 votes to place on causes they believe are most significant
>
> **Impact-Effort Matrix**: Rate each cause by impact (if addressed) and effort (to investigate/fix)
>
> **Data-driven**: Use existing data to identify most frequent/costly causes (Pareto)
>
> **Consensus**: Team discussion to agree on top 3-5 causes

After prioritization:
> The top prioritized causes are:
> 1. [Cause 1] - [votes/score]
> 2. [Cause 2] - [votes/score]
> 3. [Cause 3] - [votes/score]
>
> Would you like to apply 5 Whys analysis to drill deeper into any of these?

## Phase 6: Documentation

**Goal**: Generate visual diagram and comprehensive report.

Ask:
> Ready to generate documentation. Options:
> 1. **SVG Diagram** - Visual fishbone diagram
> 2. **HTML Report** - Complete analysis with diagram, findings, and recommendations
> 3. **Both** - Full documentation package
> 4. **JSON Export** - Structured data for integration with other tools

**Scripts**:
- `scripts/generate_diagram.py` - Creates SVG fishbone visualization
- `scripts/generate_report.py` - Creates HTML report with embedded diagram
- `scripts/export_data.py` - Exports analysis data as JSON

## Common Pitfalls

See `references/common-pitfalls.md` for detailed pitfall descriptions and redirection strategies.

**Quick reference**:
1. **Vague problem statement** → Ask for specifics (what/when/where/how much)
2. **Stopping at symptoms** → Probe with "Why might this happen?"
3. **Empty categories** → Use category-specific prompting questions
4. **Person-blame** → Redirect to "What process/system allowed this?"
5. **Groupthink** → Use brainwriting before group discussion
6. **Confirmation bias** → Challenge assumptions, seek contrary evidence
7. **Too shallow** → Add sub-cause levels
8. **Too complex** → Consider splitting into multiple diagrams

## Quality Assessment

Rate the analysis on these dimensions (see `references/quality-rubric.md`):

| Dimension | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Problem Clarity | 15% | Specific, measurable, non-blaming |
| Category Coverage | 20% | All relevant categories explored |
| Cause Depth | 25% | 2-3 levels of sub-causes |
| Cause Quality | 20% | Distinct, actionable, evidence-based |
| Prioritization | 10% | Clear method, justified rankings |
| Documentation | 10% | Complete, visual, shareable |

**Scoring**: Use `scripts/score_analysis.py` to calculate quality score.
