# Fishbone Diagram Facilitation Guide

## Pre-Session Preparation

### Logistics
- **Room setup**: Whiteboard/flipcharts visible to all, or digital tool (Miro, Lucidchart, MS Whiteboard)
- **Materials**: Markers (multiple colors), sticky notes, dots for voting
- **Time allocation**: 45-90 minutes depending on complexity
- **Participants**: 4-8 people with process knowledge (cross-functional preferred)

### Define Session Goals
1. Clear problem statement (prepared in advance if possible)
2. Target number of causes per category (minimum 3)
3. Prioritization method selected
4. Output expectations (diagram, report, action items)

## Brainstorming Techniques

### Round-Robin
**Best for**: Ensuring equal participation, avoiding dominant voices

**Process**:
1. Go around the group in order
2. Each person contributes one cause
3. "Pass" is allowed if no new ideas
4. Continue until all pass consecutively

**Tips**:
- Set a time limit per person (15-30 seconds)
- Record ideas without discussion initially
- Save clarifications for later

### Brainwriting (6-3-5 Method)
**Best for**: Avoiding groupthink, generating many ideas quickly

**Process**:
1. Each participant writes 3 ideas on paper/sticky notes (5 minutes)
2. Pass papers to the right
3. Add 3 more ideas inspired by what you read (5 minutes)
4. Repeat 4-5 times
5. Collect and cluster all ideas

**Variant - Silent Brainstorming**:
- Everyone writes on sticky notes simultaneously (10 minutes)
- Post all notes, then discuss and organize

### Category Walk
**Best for**: Ensuring thorough coverage of all categories

**Process**:
1. Post each category on separate flipcharts around the room
2. Small groups rotate through stations (5 min each)
3. Each group adds causes to the category
4. Final walkthrough to consolidate

### "Why Does This Happen?"
**Best for**: Drilling into sub-causes, adding depth

**Process**:
1. For each identified cause, ask "Why might this happen?"
2. Record answers as sub-branches
3. Continue 2-3 levels deep
4. Stop when causes become actionable or speculation begins

---

## Prioritization Methods

### Multi-Voting (Dot Voting)
**Best for**: Quick consensus, large numbers of causes

**Process**:
1. Each participant gets 3-5 votes (dots/stickers)
2. Place votes on causes believed most significant
3. Can place multiple votes on one cause or spread out
4. Tally votes to identify top causes

**Tips**:
- Votes = (Total causes / 3) per person
- Use colored dots for different criteria (impact, likelihood)
- Allow "pass" votes if uncertain

### Impact-Effort Matrix
**Best for**: Balancing significance with feasibility

**Process**:
1. Create 2x2 matrix: High/Low Impact vs High/Low Effort
2. Place each cause on the matrix
3. Prioritize: High Impact/Low Effort first

**Quadrants**:
- **Quick Wins** (High Impact, Low Effort): Prioritize
- **Major Projects** (High Impact, High Effort): Plan carefully
- **Fill-ins** (Low Impact, Low Effort): Optional
- **Avoid** (Low Impact, High Effort): Deprioritize

### Weighted Scoring
**Best for**: Objective comparison with multiple criteria

**Criteria examples**:
- Likelihood (how probable is this cause?) - Weight: 30%
- Impact (if true, how significant?) - Weight: 30%
- Controllability (can we address this?) - Weight: 20%
- Data availability (can we verify?) - Weight: 20%

**Process**:
1. Rate each cause 1-5 on each criterion
2. Calculate weighted score
3. Rank by total score

### Pareto-Guided
**Best for**: Data-rich environments

**Process**:
1. If data exists (defect logs, incident reports), categorize by cause
2. Apply 80/20 rule: 20% of causes likely drive 80% of problems
3. Prioritize based on data-backed frequency/impact

## Facilitator Guidelines

### Setting Ground Rules
1. **No criticism during brainstorming** - Evaluation comes later
2. **Build on others' ideas** - "Yes, and..." mentality
3. **Quantity over quality initially** - Filter later
4. **Stay focused on causes, not solutions** - Solutions come after
5. **Every voice matters** - No hierarchy in brainstorming

### Managing Dynamics

**Dominant participant**: 
- Use round-robin to ensure turns
- Say "Let's hear from others first"
- Use written brainstorming

**Quiet participants**:
- Direct questions: "[Name], what do you see in [Category]?"
- Pair discussions before group sharing
- Anonymous sticky note submission

**Tangents/debates**:
- Park unrelated items in a "parking lot"
- "That's a great point - let's capture it and come back"
- Gently redirect: "How does this relate to [Problem]?"

**Conflict**:
- Acknowledge different perspectives
- "Both viewpoints have merit - let's capture both"
- Use data to resolve where possible

### Quality Checkpoints

After brainstorming, verify:
- [ ] Every category has at least 2-3 causes
- [ ] Causes are specific, not vague ("poor quality" → "material thickness variation")
- [ ] No causes simply restate the problem
- [ ] Mix of obvious and non-obvious causes
- [ ] Major causes have sub-causes (2-3 levels)

### Common Facilitator Mistakes
1. **Allowing criticism too early** → Shuts down idea generation
2. **Jumping to solutions** → Incomplete cause identification
3. **Accepting the first answer** → Missing deeper causes
4. **Ignoring quiet voices** → Missing valuable perspectives
5. **Not time-boxing** → Sessions drag, energy drops
6. **Skipping prioritization** → No clear next steps

## Remote/Virtual Facilitation

### Tool Recommendations
- **Miro/Mural**: Digital whiteboards with fishbone templates
- **Lucidchart/Lucidspark**: Diagramming with collaboration
- **MS Whiteboard**: Integrated with Teams
- **FigJam**: Figma's collaborative whiteboard

### Virtual Best Practices
1. **Share template in advance** - Familiarize participants
2. **Use breakout rooms** - Small groups for category brainstorming
3. **Leverage chat** - Parallel written brainstorming
4. **Camera on** - Maintain engagement
5. **Take breaks** - Every 25-30 minutes
6. **Assign a note-taker** - Capture decisions and action items

### Asynchronous Options
1. Share diagram with categories defined
2. Participants add causes over 24-48 hours
3. Synchronous session for discussion and prioritization
4. Works well for distributed teams across time zones

---

## Post-Session Actions

### Immediate (Within 24 hours)
1. Clean up and digitize diagram
2. Share with all participants
3. Confirm prioritized causes

### Short-term (Within 1 week)
1. Assign owners for investigating top causes
2. Determine verification methods (data, experiments)
3. Set timeline for root cause confirmation

### Follow-up
1. Review investigation findings
2. Apply 5 Whys to confirmed causes
3. Develop countermeasures
4. Track implementation and effectiveness
