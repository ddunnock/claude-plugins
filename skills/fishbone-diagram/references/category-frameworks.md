# Category Frameworks Reference

## The 6Ms (Manufacturing/Operations)

The 6Ms originate from the Toyota Production System and are the standard for manufacturing root cause analysis.

### Man (Manpower/People)
**Definition**: Human factors including training, skills, fatigue, communication, and behavior.

**Prompting Questions**:
- Was the operator properly trained for this task?
- Was fatigue or stress a factor?
- Were instructions clearly understood?
- Was there adequate staffing?
- Did communication breakdowns occur?

**Common Causes**:
- Insufficient training
- Lack of experience
- Fatigue/shift issues
- Poor communication
- Inadequate supervision
- Skill gaps
- High turnover

**Note**: When "Man" is identified as a cause, often the true root cause lies in another M (inadequate training = Methods, poor tools = Machines).

### Machine (Equipment)
**Definition**: Production equipment, tools, software, and technology used in the process.

**Prompting Questions**:
- Is equipment properly maintained?
- Are calibrations current?
- Is equipment appropriate for the task?
- Were there recent equipment changes?
- Are there software issues?

**Common Causes**:
- Equipment malfunction
- Lack of maintenance
- Worn components
- Incorrect tool selection
- Software bugs
- Calibration drift
- Equipment age/obsolescence

### Method (Process)
**Definition**: Procedures, work instructions, processes, and standard operating practices.

**Prompting Questions**:
- Are procedures documented and current?
- Is the process standardized?
- Were procedures followed?
- Are there too many/too few steps?
- Has the process changed recently?

**Common Causes**:
- Missing procedures
- Outdated documentation
- Process variation
- Unclear instructions
- Too many approvals/steps
- Lack of standardization
- Recent process changes

### Material (Inputs)
**Definition**: Raw materials, components, consumables, and inputs to the process.

**Prompting Questions**:
- Were materials within specification?
- Has the supplier changed?
- Were materials properly stored?
- Is there lot-to-lot variation?
- Were materials contaminated?

**Common Causes**:
- Out-of-spec materials
- Supplier quality issues
- Storage degradation
- Contamination
- Wrong material used
- Material variability
- Supply chain disruption

### Measurement (Data/Metrics)
**Definition**: Inspection methods, data collection, measurement devices, and quality checks.

**Prompting Questions**:
- Are measurement devices calibrated?
- Is the measurement method appropriate?
- Are inspections adequate?
- Is data being collected correctly?
- Are the right things being measured?

**Common Causes**:
- Calibration errors
- Inadequate inspection
- Wrong measurement method
- Data entry errors
- Sampling issues
- Metric misalignment
- Missing quality checks

### Mother Nature (Environment)
**Definition**: Environmental conditions including temperature, humidity, cleanliness, lighting, and external factors.

**Prompting Questions**:
- Were environmental conditions controlled?
- Did weather affect operations?
- Is the workspace clean/organized?
- Are there seasonal patterns?
- Were there external disruptions?

**Common Causes**:
- Temperature fluctuation
- Humidity issues
- Contamination/cleanliness
- Poor lighting
- Noise/vibration
- Weather events
- Regulatory changes

## The 8Ps (Service/Marketing)

The 8Ps extend the marketing mix for service industry root cause analysis.

### Product
**Definition**: The goods or services being delivered.
- Quality issues, design flaws, feature gaps, reliability problems

### Price
**Definition**: Pricing strategy and value perception.
- Price-quality mismatch, competitive positioning, cost overruns

### Place (Distribution)
**Definition**: Where and how products/services are delivered.
- Location issues, delivery problems, channel conflicts

### Promotion (Marketing)
**Definition**: How offerings are communicated to customers.
- Miscommunication, unmet expectations, poor targeting

### People (Employees)
**Definition**: Staff involved in service delivery.
- Training, attitude, availability, skills, turnover

### Process
**Definition**: Service delivery workflows and systems.
- Inefficiencies, bottlenecks, lack of standardization

### Physical Evidence
**Definition**: Tangible elements of service experience.
- Facilities, equipment, documentation, appearance

### Policies
**Definition**: Rules and guidelines governing operations.
- Restrictive policies, unclear guidelines, compliance gaps

---

## The 4Ss (Service Operations)

Simplified framework for service-oriented analysis.

### Surroundings
**Definition**: Physical and virtual environment.
- Workspace design, ambient conditions, tools availability

### Suppliers
**Definition**: External parties providing inputs.
- Vendor quality, delivery reliability, communication

### Systems
**Definition**: Technology and process infrastructure.
- IT systems, workflows, automation, integrations

### Skills
**Definition**: Capabilities of people involved.
- Training, experience, knowledge, competencies

---

## Custom Frameworks

### Healthcare (5Ps)
- **Patients**: Patient factors (acuity, compliance, communication)
- **Providers**: Staff training, communication, workload
- **Procedures**: Clinical protocols, documentation
- **Products**: Equipment, supplies, medications
- **Place**: Environment, facilities, organization

### Software/IT (PEOPLE)
- **Process**: Development methodology, deployment procedures
- **Environment**: Infrastructure, configurations, dependencies
- **Operations**: Monitoring, incident response, maintenance
- **People**: Skills, training, communication, handoffs
- **Libraries**: Dependencies, third-party code, versioning
- **Equipment**: Hardware, networks, cloud services

### Project Management (6Ms variant)
- **Milestones**: Schedule, deadlines, dependencies
- **Methods**: Processes, procedures, standards
- **Materials**: Resources, inputs, deliverables
- **Machines**: Tools, software, technology
- **Manpower**: Team, skills, capacity
- **Money**: Budget, funding, costs

## Selecting the Right Framework

| Context | Recommended Framework |
|---------|----------------------|
| Manufacturing defects | 6Ms |
| Production delays | 6Ms |
| Quality issues | 6Ms |
| Customer complaints | 8Ps |
| Service failures | 8Ps or 4Ss |
| Healthcare incidents | 5Ps (Healthcare) |
| Software bugs | PEOPLE (Software) |
| Project issues | 6Ms variant |
| Unknown/general | Start with 6Ms, adapt as needed |

**Principle**: Choose the framework that best fits your context, but don't hesitate to customize. The categories are prompts for thinking, not rigid constraints.
