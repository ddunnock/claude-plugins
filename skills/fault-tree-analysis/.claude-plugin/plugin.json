  "description": "Conduct Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) to systematically identify and analyze causes of system failures using Boolean logic gates. Top-down deductive method for safety and reliability engineering. Use when analyzing system failures, evaluating safety-critical designs, calculating failure probabilities, identifying minimal cut sets, assessing redundancy effectiveness, or when user mentions \"fault tree\", \"FTA\", \"system failure analysis\", \"minimal cut sets\", \"safety analysis\", \"failure probability\", \"AND/OR gates\", or needs to trace failure pathways from top event to basic events. Supports qualitative structure analysis and quantitative probability calculations.",
