# Tutorials

**Learning-oriented** documentation that teaches through guided, hands-on lessons.

## Purpose

Tutorials help newcomers get started by walking them through a complete project from beginning to end. The focus is on the learning experience, not just the final outcome.

## Writing Guidelines

- **Use "we" language**: "First, we'll create...", "Now we can see..."
- **Include every step**: Don't assume knowledge; make steps explicit
- **Show results**: Include expected output after each significant step
- **Keep it focused**: Avoid tangents and "advanced" asides
- **Test with beginners**: Have someone new to the project follow along
