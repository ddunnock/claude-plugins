# ISO 9001:2015: Quality Management Systems

## Overview

ISO 9001:2015 is the international standard for quality management systems. Clause 10.2 provides requirements for corrective action that form the basis of CAPA (Corrective and Preventive Action) processes.

**Standard:** ISO 9001:2015
**Title:** Quality management systems - Requirements
**Edition:** 5th Edition (2015)
**Publisher:** International Organization for Standardization (ISO)

## Required For

| RCCA Skill | Usage |
|------------|-------|
| Five Whys Analysis | Root cause investigation requirements (10.2.1) |
| Problem Definition | Nonconformity handling process (10.2.1) |
| RCCA Master | CAPA template structure, effectiveness review (10.2.2) |

## Key Content: Clause 10.2

Clause 10.2 "Nonconformity and corrective action" is the primary section for RCCA:

### 10.2.1 - Immediate Response

When nonconformity occurs, the organization shall:

a) React to the nonconformity:
   - Take action to control and correct it
   - Deal with the consequences

b) Evaluate the need for action to eliminate causes:
   - Review and analyze the nonconformity
   - Determine causes
   - Determine if similar nonconformities exist or could occur

c) Implement actions needed

d) Review effectiveness of corrective actions

e) Update risks and opportunities if necessary

f) Make changes to the QMS if necessary

### 10.2.2 - Documentation Requirements

Retain documented information as evidence of:

- Nature of nonconformities and subsequent actions
- Results of any corrective action

## Acquisition Options

### 1. ISO Store (Official)

**Link:** https://www.iso.org/standard/62085.html

**Price:** CHF 162 (~$180 USD) for PDF

**Format:** PDF (single-user license)

**Notes:**
- Official version with all clauses
- Required for ISO certification audits
- Includes Annex A (clarification of requirements)

### 2. National Standards Bodies

ISO standards are also sold through national member bodies, sometimes at different prices:

| Country | Organization | Link |
|---------|--------------|------|
| USA | ANSI | https://webstore.ansi.org/ |
| UK | BSI | https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/iso-9001-quality-management/ |
| Germany | DIN | https://www.beuth.de/ |
| Canada | SCC | https://www.scc.ca/ |

### 3. Institutional Access

**Check your organization:**
- Quality management department often has copies
- Document control systems (e.g., MasterControl, ETQ)
- Standards subscriptions (IHS Markit, Techstreet, SAI Global)

**Academic access:**
- University libraries often provide ISO standards
- Engineering database subscriptions

### 4. Free Alternatives

**Important:** The full ISO 9001:2015 text is copyrighted. However, summaries and interpretations are available:

**ASQ (American Society for Quality) Resources:**
- https://asq.org/quality-resources/iso-9001
- Free articles explaining Clause 10.2 requirements
- NOT the official standard text

**ISO Preview:**
- https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:9001:ed-5:v1:en
- Free preview of table of contents and scope
- Does NOT include full clause text

**Note for RCCA Skills:**
- Free summaries provide CAPA process guidance
- Full standard text provides more detailed requirements
- RCCA skills work with either but show richer results with full standard

## Ingestion Command

After acquiring the PDF:

```bash
cd mcps/knowledge-mcp

poetry run python -m knowledge_mcp.cli.ingest docs iso-9001-2015.pdf \
  --collection rcca_standards \
  --document-id iso-9001-2015 \
  --validate
```

**Document ID Pattern:** Use lowercase with hyphens: `iso-9001-2015`

## Expected Validation Results

```
Validating collection: rcca_standards

Critical Tables:
  [PASS] Clause 10.2 Corrective Action
    - Clause 10.2.1 requirements present
    - Clause 10.2.2 documentation requirements present
    - Root cause analysis mentioned

  [PASS] CAPA Process Elements
    - Nonconformity reaction steps
    - Cause determination
    - Effectiveness review
    - Documentation requirements

Chunks: 100-200 (typical - ISO 9001 is relatively compact)
Metadata: standard=ISO 9001:2015, domain=quality, version=2015
```

## CAPA Process Template

From ISO 9001:2015 Clause 10.2, RCCA skills extract this CAPA structure:

1. **Identify** - Document the nonconformity
2. **Contain** - Take immediate action to control
3. **Analyze** - Determine root cause
4. **Correct** - Implement corrective action
5. **Verify** - Review effectiveness
6. **Update** - Modify processes/documentation as needed

## Troubleshooting

### "Clause 10.2 not found"

1. Verify you have the complete standard (not just a preview)
2. Search explicitly: `"Clause 10.2 corrective action ISO 9001"`
3. Check if metadata shows `domain=quality`

### Low chunk count (<50)

ISO 9001:2015 is a compact document (~30 pages). Low chunk counts are normal. Verify that:

1. All clauses are present (check for Clause 10.2 specifically)
2. PDF is not just the table of contents/preview
3. Text layer exists (not scanned image)

### Copyright Restrictions

ISO standards have strict copyright. Do NOT:

- Share ingested content outside your organization
- Redistribute the PDF
- Use for commercial redistribution

Ingestion for personal/organizational RCCA analysis is acceptable under fair use.
